# Closed-loop-Brain-Stimulation-Controller-Using-Machine-Learning-Sprint-2
A closed-loop system using machine learning to adjust brain stimulation settings (intensity, timing) for improved memory performance. It learns optimal patterns from EEG data over time, combining neurostimulation, EEG analysis, and adaptive ML-based control.
